# Hive

## Purpose

This project evolved out of the [crud application demo](http://github.com/angular-app/angular-app). Although, the parent (http://github.com/angular-app/angular-app), was intended as a learning tool, our focus was to add features that we thought would add further value.

Please note that this is still a work in progress. As of now this is a fork of the parent, but down the line we might be making it a stand alone repository.

### New features added
* Burndown charts
* Visualizations (Pie charts, etc)
* Kanban board
* Supports item hierarchies
* Sprint planning based on resource and time constraints
* Item timelines via [gantt charts]() 
* Task timers
* Tool to capture daily scrum notes of the team
* Completely revamped look (based on Bootstrap v3.1.1)

### Dependencies
* [jqPlot](http://www.jqplot.com/) for visualizations
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for layout and iconography
* [angular-bootstrap](http://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap) for ui container components and bootstrap styled widgets
* [momentjs](http://momentjs.com/)
* [Gantt charts](http://github.com/mustafavzg/angular-gantt) for item timelines
* [underscorejs](http://underscorejs.org/)
